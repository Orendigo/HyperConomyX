HyperConomyX
===========

HyperConomyX is an updated and refined version of the original HyperConomy plugin by RegalOwl, the all in one economy and shop plugin. HyperConomyX is most known for its dynamic pricing model, but it has a variety of other features including chest shops, player shops, and server shops.

Note: HyperConomyX is still in beta, and several features continue to be broken in 1.16. We are working hard to fix some of these problems.
